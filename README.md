## VMAC (PiHat Video Matrix Audio Controller)

The VMAC v3 PiHat ifeatures FOUR A/V inputs and ONE A/V output, complete with OSD (On Screen Display).

Based on the original HAMKit VMAC AV PiHat v2.4, it is a small board which provides a very flexible Audio and Video Switching Matrix, with on-board DTMF Decoder, OSD Graphics, Video Signal Detectors and EEPROM.

Size 85mm x 56mm x 15mm.  Software is open source.

This may principally be used as a Raspberry Pi add-on board, or connected to other devices such as Arduino or Microchip, via i2c.

Typical applications for the VMAC PiHat v3 are:

- ATV and DATV Repeater Control Logic
- ATV home, mobile or portable stations
- FM Repeater Control Logic
- Audio / Video matrix controller
- ATV/DATV
- CCTV (Matrix or Auto Cycle Select)
- FPV (5GHz Video Camera Receivers)
- Video remote switching
- Audio remote switching
